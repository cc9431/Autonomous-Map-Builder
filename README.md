# Autonomous Map Builder
### Final Project â€“ Introduction to Artificial Intelligence (CMSC 251)

Unity2D Simulation of an autonomous robot that builds a map of the current environment.

User is given the ability to build walls throughout environment and place robot. Robot maps out current area using a radar and then travels using A* path-finding until mapping is complete.
